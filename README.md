# Data Augmentation In Deep Learning Using TensorFlow

This tutorial demonstrates the impact of data augmentation on the performance of a deep learning model. We will use the TensorFlow framework and the `albumentations` library to augment our image dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of TensorFlow
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

## Overview

1. **Load and Visualize Data:** Load the MNIST dataset and visualize a sample image.
2. **Train Model Without Augmentation:** Train a simple model without data augmentation and visualize its performance.
3. **Apply Data Augmentation:** Use the `albumentations` library to apply data augmentation techniques to the images.
4. **Train Model With Augmentation:** Train a new model using the augmented dataset and visualize its performance.
5. **Conclusion:** Compare the performance of the models with and without data augmentation.

## Step by Step Explanation

1. **Load and Visualize Data:** Load the MNIST dataset using `tfds.load()` and visualize a sample image using `PIL.Image.open()` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

2. **Train Model Without Augmentation:** Define a simple model using TensorFlow's Keras API. Split the dataset into training and validation sets using the `tfds.as_supervised()` and `tfds.split()` methods. Train the model without any data augmentation and visualize its performance.

3. **Apply Data Augmentation:** Apply data augmentation techniques to the images using the `albumentations` library. We will use a combination of rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and saturation adjustment.

4. **Train Model With Augmentation:** Train a new model using the augmented dataset and visualize its performance.

5. **Conclusion:** Compare the performance of the models with and without data augmentation. Observe that the model trained with augmentation outperforms the model trained without augmentation.

## Conclusion

Data augmentation plays a crucial role in improving the performance of deep learning models. By augmenting the data during training, we can teach the model to be more robust and invariant to various transformations. This can result in higher accuracy and better generalization.

Note: The accuracy numbers may vary depending on the specific random augmentations applied during the training process. The main point of this tutorial is to demonstrate the impact of data augmentation on model performance.
